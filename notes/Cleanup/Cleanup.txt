What went write:
- Atmosphere is good
- No complaints on art


Problems:
- Progresson is too confusing
- Nothing very intresting happens when you loop
- Failure in looping sucks
- Instructions on controls do not exist
- Thumbnail is not eye catching
- Need better screenshots & gifs
- Payoff / scare does not exist


Puzzles are confusing
* Add in light sources around the house so the player does not have to wander so much.

Failure is frustrating
* 

Pacing is too slow
* Need to add in more story elements and scares to the middle.

Finding things in the dark is too hard
* Add in lights sources

No instructions
* Add simple instruction asset in the first room and make it disapear once the player hits a trigger.

Too much down time while walking in the house. 
People need more feedback from the game. This is a pacing issue.
* Add in story elements through audio or text for the player to find each loop.

THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING SO IT CAUSES CONFUSION THAT WE DO NOT WANT.
